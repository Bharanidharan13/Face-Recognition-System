A real-time face recognition-based attendance system built with Python. It detects known faces using a webcam and marks attendance in a CSV file, all through a simple GUI.

## 📄 Abstract

This project implements an automated attendance system using facial recognition. It leverages the `face_recognition` and `OpenCV` libraries for face detection and matching, and uses `Tkinter` for the graphical interface. Images of known individuals are used to train the system, and attendance is recorded each time a face is recognized.
